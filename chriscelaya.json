    "markdown": "Christopher\n\nCelaya\n\n# About Me\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am a mechatronic technologist and software developer, where I work on industrial manufacturing equipment, software, and web development. Before my obsession with technology, I was primarily focused on music production. During COVID-19, I distributed my first album on streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy investing in learning new things, building web apps, and further expand my ideas. I am particularly interested in complex projects with artificial intelligence, virtual reality, industrial manufacturing, data centers, and blockchain technology. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nWith over 11 years of experience troubleshooting complex electromechanical systems and developing software solutions, I believe I have the skills and background to excel in this position. As outlined on my attached resume, I have extensive hands-on experience maintaining and repairing industrial equipment and machinery. From pneumatic and hydraulic systems to PLCs and HMIs, I have worked with a wide variety of components and understand how to keep production lines running smoothly. I also have experience with programming languages C Python and JavaScript and have worked on projects involving robotics, computer vision, and embedded systems. In addition to my technical expertise, I am an analytical and solutions-oriented professional. Whether troubleshooting sudden breakdown or planning major upgrades, I can systematically evaluate problems, weigh alternatives, and implement effective solutions.\n\n## Objective\n\nTo obtain an Industrial Mechanic role that leverages my 11+ years of experience troubleshooting complex industrial equipment and developing robust software solutions for manufacturing systems, instrumentation, and robotics. I offer my expertise in preventative maintenance, manufacturing processes, and programming languages to improve production efficiency, uptime, quality, and innovation.\n\nMy goal is to utilize my skill set in automation technologies to reduce downtime and drive process improvements through systemic analysis and effective implementations.\n\n## Core Skills\n\n### Industrial Automation\n\nPLCs\n\nSCADA\n\nHMIs\n\nIndustrial IoT Devices\n\nRobotic Proceses\n\nVision Inspection\n\nAutomated Guided Vehicles (AGVs)\n\n### Technologies\n\nMachine Learning\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nDeep Learning\n\nVirtual Reality\n\nBlockchain\n\nData Centers\n\nManufacturing\n\n### Mechanical Systems\n\nChillers\n\nHydraulics\n\nCompressors\n\nAir Handling\n\nPneumatic\n\nConveyors & Material Handling\n\nCooling Towers\n\nPlumbing\n\nFire Suppression\n\n### Electrical Systems\n\nPower Distribution\n\nTransformers\n\nCircuit Breakers and Switchgear\n\nElectric Motors (AC/DC)\n\nVariable Frequency Drives (VFDs)\n\nGenerators and Backup Power Systems\n\nControl Panels and PLCs\n\nElectrical Grounding\n\n### Software Development\n\nPython\n\nJavaScript\n\nReact\n\nNode.js\n\nC\n\nC++\n\nHTML\n\nCSS\n\nTailwind\n\nGit\n\nGitHub\n\nDocker\n\nNext.js\n\nMongoDB",
